At 12:00 on January 13, 2021, because the personal blog went down, the raw content was uploaded to github.

The purpose of this article is **hope that younger students should never join Pinduoduo**, from the perspective of a lower-level employee, to record the overall changes of Pinduoduo in the past three years. This article does not involve technical secrets, only the administrative system, Cultural atmosphere, office experience, etc., record personal subjective wishes, write at home after leaving the job, record the experience, there are subjective impressions, part of the content has been mosaic-processed.

There is no need to be anonymous. According to Pinduoduo's ability, it is very easy to find out who to post by matching the time period.

I entered university in 2013 and graduated in 2017. I was very active in cc98 forum, and gradually moved away after graduation. On June 18, 2018, I was recruited by Pinduoduo. After 2.5 years of work, I intentionally came back to cc98 to talk about the changes of Pinduoduo over the past three years. To sum up, it is getting worse and worse. I hope that the younger students will never go. . In addition, I have resigned and have not received the resignation certificate and the annual overtime pay. HR promises to send it within 4-7 days. This Wednesday is the eighth day. If I have not received the resignation certificate or the courier number, I will come Update "How to Resign from Pinduoduo in Disgrace" [January 13, 2021 12:33:40, a copy of resignation certificate has been received. 】Resignation is more exciting than usual.

Interlude, in the process of writing this article, on January 11, an employee of Pinduoduo had been fire because of persuading other students to not join Pinduoduo. Fortunately, I have resigned and won't give the company a chance to expel me.

It has been a long, long time since I have been dissatisfied with Pinduoduo. It was not because “When a wall is about to collapse, everybody gives it a push”. I submitted the resignation letter on December 9, 2020. I originally wanted to leave and stay quiet for 30 days then write a sum up. But, from January 1, 2021 to the present, the company has been keeping me busy all the way, so I didn’t have time to write an article. I have to work overtime to write and publish this article.

Pinduoduo, the environment in 2018 is normal, the environment in 2019 is getting worse, the environment in 2020 is very bad, and the environment in 2021 has been blackened and so I resigned; if you want to look directly at the key points, start with 2019.

# 2018

Generally speaking, Pinduoduo in 2018 is quite good, and I am very happy.

### Entry

Before joining the job, Xuanyuan (common name flanker) told me: "I went to a startup company, lack of people, the position is very suitable for you, do you want to come, the founder is from Shanghai and Zhejiang University...". After investigating, Brother A also went. He went to work six days a week and clocked in strictly. It was not unacceptable. After being released by Ant Financial, I went to pdd.

I entered the post on June 18, 2018. At that time, there was only serveral person in the technical security group. I saw my supervisor Xuanyuan (now resigned, there is also a big drama, Pinduoduo fired his security director take his RSU back because he refused to cyber attack company's competitors), student B that I have known for many years (resigned after the internship), and the senior student C who has been admired for a long time. , One side of the fate of D, the senior sister E who appeared in the industry news (now resigned), and I asked about the SRC top leader F, and several other excellent colleagues. It seems that I might be the worst. There are still many things to learn when I came here. Later I found that I actually did a great job at that time.

Feelings on the day of entry: At that time, the office facilities were really rudimentary, the workstations were very crowded, and there was no staff canteen. For meals, you need to use the "Meican" APP to order food, go to the shelf according to your own number, and then take it to your seat. Basically, you can eat when you are hungry. You can pick up the meal at any time between 11:30-12:00. Although the dining room is very small, it is not crowded. The experience is ordinary, but it is better than zju's meal. (Foreshadowing 1 here, system update in 2019)

The office did not have a seat number at the time. When I needed to find someone, I could only describe my location roughly, which was very uncomfortable. A few months later, the administration used the "five continents" and seat number to solve this difficult problem, which was very good.

The first "staff dormitory" I lived in was said to be a staff dormitory, but the conditions were pretty bad. In the 1990 house, there were two rooms and zero halls. The living room was a long strip. There were two beds in each bedroom (the bed next to me was temporarily vacant) and there was no other furnitures. The other two roommates were very nice. One roommate had broadband access and played online games with me. Although we were late from get off work, he was very optimistic. The other roommate left Pinduoduo seven days later and joined Bytedance(tiktok owner) in Shanghai. This house may be the worst residence I have ever seen since graduation. It is very noisy facing the street and stays at a level that I can live in temporarily. For short-term interns, it is relatively convenient and not suitable for long-term residence.

Fifteen days later, I and G (now resigned) rented other place together. We lived in an old house opposite the office, it was built in 1990. One person one bedroom. In the office, you can see the windows of the room. It takes just 3 minute to go to work place. Of course, this place is quite shabby. Fortunately, roommate G is very good at living. He instructed me to buy blackout curtains, electric blankets, water pumps, and light bulbs together so I can live well and have hot bath. The only advantage is that I am close to the company. way too close. Pinduoduo needs to go to work on Sundays. On Saturdays, when I have nothing to do, I just go to the office. I can use "MeiCan" to order food (Foreshadowing 2). There is Internet and free to use (Foreshadowing 3). I am in the office with intern H Spend the boring time on Saturday.

### Getting familiar

Slowly, there were more people in the group and more projects to work on, and it was fun. Due to the small number of people and the large number of projects, I started from scratch. In 2018, I founded and took charge of multiple projects such as A, B, C, D, E, etc., and participated in the company’s security emergency response many times. Obtained excellent performance, but also because of quarrels with other colleagues due to disagreements, and received a poor performance. Although it is the same as in 2020, I work six days a week, but in 2018 I really feel that Pinduoduo is very good and can do a lot of practical things. In the security group, protect Pinduoduo’s servers, user security, business security, and prevent hackers. These things make me very proud of seeing the results.

At that time, I saw a friend from cc98 forum @xxx had joined and felt very happy to have one more friend, so I have to talk about Management Trainee’s experience here.

xxx was a market management trainee at the time, and I was in R&D, and the company's professional arrangements for the two were completely different. One day, I got off work from 21:00 to 22:00. I heard that xxx was still working until 23:00. I was shocked. It turned out that the they as fresh graduates in the first half of the year should work in customer service. There is a strict reporting system for efficiency evaluation and KPI, and the content of work is easy to make people nervous. I have noticed that something is wrong with her. I lent her my keyboard to ease the pain. Anyway, I have nothing to do after get off work. Out of humanitarianism, sometimes I send her back in the middle of the night and then walk back by myself.

Because the food in Pinduoduo was better (later found that it was too greasy to eat the official takeaway every day), I was getting fat from 55kg to 65kg, so I started to think about losing weight, and 5 colleagues around changed their avatars to "no losing 5kg without changing their avatars" At that time, I had time to go for a run after get off work in the evening even few days after 23:00. I feel lucky now that I was not dead. Later, when the weather getting cold, I exercised indoors and it was almost reduced to between 55kh to 60kg.

Except for the six-day shift, I don’t seem to have much to complain about. When I’m single, it’s really painful on weekends.

### 11.11 on duty

Half a year later, Double Eleven (an online event like Black Friday that happens during 11th November in China)came. It was the first time I experienced an event of this scale. The technicians were required to be divided into three waves. They were on duty at 11.10 night, 11.11 morning, and 11.11 night. There were not many people in the security team; because I lived close, I took the duty to bear that night for the students who lived far away. I was still very excited at the time. On the one hand, I wanted to buy something for cheaper price. On the other hand, I also wanted to see if there were any hackers intruding during event. Although I left early in the morning, I was quite satisfied.

On Double Eleven, it seems that I went to work for ten days in a row, and then got two days off. At this time, a sister E took me to Hangzhou to meet her friend, and her friend became my girlfriend in the end, Encouraged by love, I have been very happy for the remaining few months. I work six days a week. I went to Hangzhou by high-speed train for a date in my free day. I walk in the morning and go back at night without feeling tired at all.

### All-member conference and annual meeting

After Pinduoduo's IPO in United State, I heard there were a lot of negative comments, but I am an engineer and it has nothing to do with me. After quiet period ended, the company held an all-staff meeting to look forward to the future and encourage everyone. I can only remember one sentence at the moment, Huang Zheng said "Some colleague asked that when can we have weekends?" (Cheers) "The answers is when we become the second in China" (Cheers).

Has it improved in 2021? No. . .

Then there will be the annual meeting. It is quite satisfactory and the food is pretty good. I have made more contributions and won the annual outstanding employee prize. There are many people with this title, and each group should have several places. After hearing a few familiar names, I feel that the evaluation is well deserved.

### Unpleasant episode

I really don't remember the details, maybe the time is interspersed in the above.

The internal IM software is the QQ Enterprise Version, and there is a large group of many people called the Shanghai Employee Group, 99% of whom in Shanghai are in the group, chatting daily. One day, someone from the bank came to promote their Hong Kong bank card. They created a WeChat group. Colleagues recommended each other. There may be 100 colleagues. I was also in that group. Suddenly, HR came in in the WeChat group and told us to disband the group immediately, then I was removed from the group chat. The next day, the large group also disbanded, and the official reason was: "In order to prevent personal information from leaking." Later, this kind of thing became very frequent, including a group for single employees to make friends (there was no one to speak there actually), the ball sports group, and so on.

I'm still confused about this matter. I don't know how the internal IM leaks personal information. Everyone in the group is company employee. The company just finds an excuse to dissolve the group and shut the employees' mouths.

# 2019

Everything changed after that incident. . . . .

### A 100 yuan coupon incident makes all staff on duty 7*24

2019.1.10 It was a weekend. When I woke up, my girlfriend said to me, "Your company has something wrong, you can get unlimited 100 yuan coupon." "What are you talking about, that's a lie". "Oh, I didn't get it." So I went to work, and when I arrived at the office, my girlfriend didn't lie to me. It was true. There was a serious incident. There were various reports in succession. And this incident was just a fuse.

This is a very big problem. Risk control and the broader market are both responsible. I thought that each system would be connected to risk control, run full API check, code review, etc., to solve similar problems from a technical point of view, but Pinduoduo's reaction make me stunned.

After the Chinese New Year, the risk control team will be on duty 7*24 hours, and each technical staff must be on duty. The morning shift is 7:00 to 19:00 and the evening shift is 19:00 to 7:00. Although it is not very reasonable, it can be regarded as a temporary solution.

A few days later, all the technical staff began to be on duty 7*24 hours. I would like to emphasize it a few times, all technical staff! All technical staff! All technical staff!

That night, I was very impressed. The supervisor gathered us around . In the meeting room, the atmosphere was heavy. "To tell you the bad news, we also have to be on duty. For specific rules, I 'll read the original rules..." Everyone is very reluctant. The general rule is: two shifts a day, each group sends 1 person, new graduates is not on duty for half a year, girls are not on duty for late shifts, social recruits are not on duty for x months, and there is an extra 0.5 day of overtime for night shifts Fees, early shifts can leave early. Since there are too few meets the standard in our group, we only arrange evening shifts, not morning shifts.

Evaluate this system from a personal perspective. First of all, I don’t do online business. There are only a few people who does. I can’t let people be online 24 hours all day long. Then, I don’t have any authority to deal with other people’s problem; again, other people’s service is down. , I don’t know how to restore it; in the end, I came to the conclusion that my responsibility is to read the alerts, and call him to wake up when the service is down.

The evening shift is from 19:00 to 7:00. According to the official explanation, it is necessary to stay overnight in the office, it is allowed not to work, you can play with your mobile phones, your leave other things alone to concentrate on alarm emails. For the sake of employees, it is allowed to leave 1am but should keep an eye on in your home. Combining my experience on duty many times, It's just praying shit wont't happen and let me sleep in peace.

Let me share the memories of the first time on duty: sign in at 19:00, continue to woking until everyone is gone, play with mobile phones, at 01:00, go home, play mobile phones in bed, sleep at 3:00, wake up occasionally to read the emails. wake up at 07:00 and clock in.

Basically, I didn’t sleep all night and got 0.5 times the salary. The whole process was very boring. It was purely mess around with people. After seeing this essence, out of health considerations, on one hand, I'll hand the duty over to other people. On the other hand, if I really can’t get out, I was just slacking and for most of the nights, nothing happens.

At the beginning, I still had a fluke mentality. I thought that this duty lasted for a few months and found no effect, and it could end. Now in 2021, the duty system from my perspective has not had any effect so far, it becomes mandatory, but I cannot find a clear-written regulations about it. The earliest protection system does not exist anymore. Girls are also on night shifts. The newly recruits are also on the night shift. Here I just want to say that the decision-making people simply don’t have a brain.

### Moving stations and overcrowding

As more and more people are recruited, the entire team must move out of the original work space. From entry to resignation, I have moved for like 8 times. At first it was really due to the number of people. Later, I discovered that this is a tradition of Pinduoduo, which is to mess around with people. Frequent relocation can only show that the administrative level is poor and have no plan ahead.

Then there will be toilet problems, such as the well-known "shit" news(some one pooped in the urinal), things that everyone is scolding, I will not start to talk about it, there has been no improvement for so many years.

### Eliminate foreshadowing

As mentioned above, some of the better systems in 2018 will no longer exist in 2019, and the company is restricting employees more strongly.

Foreshadowing 1: The loose eating time is cancelled, and people have to eat in certain time point like a pig.

One day in 2019, the comany found out that some employees went to eat midnight snack at 21:30, and suddenly a rule came up, saying that it is forbidden to go to the dining room before 12:00, 18:00 or 22:00.

The original system: 9 to 10 o’clock breakfast, 12 o’clock lunch, 18 o’clock dinner, (you can get it early, and work early after eating). Midnight snack at 22:00 on Tuesday and Thursday.

Optimized system: the time point remains the same, and it is forbidden to eat in advance.

My personal schedule is to go to the office at 9:30, eat breakfast, skip lunch if not hungry, order some fruit to eat in the afternoon to lose weight (foreshadowing 4), if hungry at 17:00 then go to dinner.

Remember that I said the dining room is small but not crowded? As soon as this new policy came, at 11:59:59, there was a super long queue at the door, the staff pinched the watch and refused to let you in. At one point, everyone rushed to queue and started eating! If you are late, no one will be unable to receive a meal without a 5-minute line up. In fact, the meal delivery is almost finished at 11:30, it getting cold at then but you are now allowed to eat it, how do you feel about it?

When the supervision is not strict, this system will be relaxed, for example, you can enter at 11:59:30, but it will often be tightened, for example. Example 1: A commissioner looked at it and said that it hadn't arrived, and it could not be taken and you should be criticized by your supervisor. Example 2: The supplier said that they can’t give it to you early, they will deduct our money if they give it to you early. The former is the company's lackey, and the latter is just the company's excuse to deduc other people's money.

I would like to call this policy the pig feeding policy. As far as I know, only feeding pigs requires such a strict time arrangement.

Foreshadowing 2: Fruits were removed, and the dessert of the meal is removed.

The original system: There are plenty of suppliers for ordering. You can order fruits for lunch and dinner, and desserts for dinner.

One day, because some employees lived nearby, they ordered a piece of fruit at noon on Saturday and took it to the office to eat at home. In this regard, I criticized that this employee did not do the right thing.

The interesting thing is here, because on Saturday at noon there are unduly employees who come to get free fruit, the company decided to cancel the daily fruit supply. I, a weight-loss person, was very unpleasant. I had breakfast at 9:30 and couldn't eat lunch at all can no longer get any fruits.

Foreshadowing 3: From a certain day, the office network prohibits access to certain websites.

In fact, I support this system. It’s normal to prohibit videos sites during work hours to prevent employees from being slacking. But the pitfall is that this network shielding range is very mysterious and there is an unreasonable range, for example: Microsoft Update, Microsoft Store, IntellijIdea official website, mobile app store, Huawei login (unintelligible), Apple update push (later canceled), AppleStore ( After release). At the beginning, I could whiten the wrongly blocked website by talking to the administrator, but it couldn't do so any more. I had to go through the full process and let the supervisor approve, so I directly connect to the hot spot with my cellphone for testing (Foreshadowing 5).

Let me tell you another joke. One day, a certain app of a big boss could not be accessed, so it was added to the whitelist immediately; but when I visited some programming sites, it was indeed a formal and legitimate request but was intercepted. I gave an opinion to IT. , But IT said no, because you are not the big boss. Yeah, whatever..

### Company news circulation

For example, the three foreshadowings above were not officially notified, and they were transferred from the senior management to the supervisor. The supervisor then pasted it in the group so that the employees would know. If this announcement is prone to cause public opinion, the company will choose to spread it word of mouth, and finally let employees know it slowly.

Officials generally only notify two things, one is that an employee has been fired, and the other is that a few days of vacation will be deducted for the next holiday.

To tell a joke, there are no internal announcements about what happens inside the company. The channels for employees to obtain announcements are to inquire about each other and hang out in the Maimai community. It is very ironic, which is called export-to-domestic sales.

As mentioned above, the QQ group and some private WeChat groups were disbanded. Finally, one day, the company made it further more. Around June 2019, all WeChat groups if there is any HR were disbanded, and the department WeChat groups were also ordered to disband. The group disappears. Only a few people who are very familiar will have a WeChat group for the convenience of speaking. Once discovered by HR, they will be ordered to disband.

Shut employees' mouths, covering employees' ears, focusing on work and get paid, this is the meaning of duty.

By the way, due to the long time lack of documentation and search functions, everything basically depends on asking. For example, technical examples: how to configure the company's xxx and what to do if xxx cannot log; non-technical examples, what is the employee manual, Where are the rules and regulations on 7*24 duty? What does duty refer to? Is duty a pocket crime?

### Classic event 1: Check and monitor to confirm attendance

Pinduoduo requires clocking in and out of get off work, which are before 11 o'clock and 20 o'clock respectively. For example, when I arrive at the company at 10 o'clock and start to work. I can use computer boot records, browser history, git history, chat records, etc. to prove that I have actually come, and the supervisor will admit it.

One day, it was rumored that there was an employee boot the  computer for the employee sitting next to him. The executives were furious and decided that the HR check and monitoring would be required to replenish the card in the future, and no longer recognized any proofs.

At the time, I still felt sorry for HR, and they had to check the monitoring videp tapes for everythings. One year later, weird operations gradually appeared. The replacement card needed to provide a resume of the candidate. The replacement card was linked to the performance of the supervisor. The supervisor began to emphasize that everyone must check in when they go to work.

The company distrusts its employees very much, and thinks in a bad direction.

### Classic incident 2: Absenteeism on duty on Saturday was expelled collectively

On a Saturday, some unscrupulous employees were on duty during the day from 7 to 19 o'clock. They slipped out during lunch and haven't returned after a few hours. A few days later, all staff members announced and expelled after the investigation.

The employee did wrong, but the crime is not dying, because there was only one type of person who had been expelled before for accepting bribes. This was the first technical public expulsion.

### Classic incident 3: Check employee mobile phones and fire a younger student who posted questions about air quality in Maimai

### Classic Event 4: On duty intensified

Pinduoduo has four big promotions at 618, 1010, 1111, 1212. I thought it was the same as in 18 years, but I was still too naive.

This time it is required that all technicians are on duty, and everyone needs to be on duty until one o'clock in the morning, except for those on the morning shift the next day.

By the way, this duty is for public welfare and free of charge. After two consecutive nights, we are off work early in the morning. Generally speaking, it is white prostitution. Because I do low-level support and do not have online business, no matter how long I stay, there is no help. Many people also set up a phenomenon, but there is no way, the order must be executed. At one o'clock in the morning, the elevator was crowded like an explosion. There were xxxx people and 6 elevators. When it really got downstairs, it was already 1:30 in the morning.

Oh, by the way, if the big promotion is on Monday, the company will require two days of work on weekends, which means that you can work for up to 13 days. On the same day, one, two, three, four, five, and one, two, three, four, five. Who can stand it after get off work early in the morning?

I am very disdainful of the company's arrangement and feel ashamed.

### Classic Event 5: The company wiki removes search, recent visits and other functions

The wiki is a place used to store notes and share work content. In order to prevent information leakage, the official removed related functions. The price is to cut off the connection between various departments and various businesses. I don’t know where to put the documents I edited any day. I don’t know where to search or who to look for when there is a problem with the company’s components. Development depends on asking. For new recruits, it is undoubtedly a huge test, but managers do not care about the life and death of technology, and this kind of thing is not a day or two.

### Classic Event 6: The company is prohibited from engaging in side business

One day, the company announced that it was forbidden to engage in sideline businesses and required honest reporting. According to my cognition, sideline refers to signing a labor or labor service contract, which is inappropriate behavior, but this is another pocket crime. There are only six words "prohibited to engage in sideline business" without detailed explanation. This is also a very common oral notice. . For this reason, a colleague was expelled for selling things on WeChat.

To share this example, I want to show that the original intention of the company may be good, but it does not consider the actual situation when it is implemented, and there is no clear sentence.

### Record diary

"Who writes a diary for a serious person", indeed, I am not a serious person, because I wanted to resign at the end of 2019, so I opened a special notebook to record the moment when my mentality exploded. The following is an excerpt from the diary. Resignation is always a momentary matter. If you are really busy, you may be too lazy to resign, so it is specially recorded to prevent the pain from being forgotten.

November 2019

Tenosynovitis, my hand is about to break, go to the hospital, the doctor said less activity

November 2019

When I received the business, I only provided some analysis and reference. I didn’t understand network programming at all. Now I’m learning and selling, adding a lot of knowledge I don’t know, and the pressure is huge. Although I finally figured it out, I left this function to a professional. To write, it is much better than what I am learning now. During that time, I had nightmares every day and it was very uncomfortable.

November-December 2019

I did not provide an account or a mobile phone when I received a test request from the business, and let me operate out of thin air;

December 2019

When I get sick, almost everyone gets sick again, one by one, and the office staff is too dense;

There are too many people in line when picking up a meal, and eating will pass through the infected area, causing widespread infection, and the state is worrying;

I'm sick and have a fever and I'm dying, at least I have a girlfriend who can take care of me;
...

I don't remember the old man anymore

### New Year's Eve on duty

It feels like a joke again. 2019 is almost New Year's Eve and I will be working on the 31st. Around December 20th, as a young man, of course I have to take time off to go out to play. Then came the interesting news. It was announced on December 25 that all employees were required to stay in the office on New Year’s Eve on the 31st and leave work at 1 am. No special reason is allowed.

I was stunned again when I saw this news. It was the first time I heard that there was a big promotion for the New Year, and I only notified it a few days in advance. Isn’t this a messenger? So Maimai has a classic post: "The entire company during the New Year People are all in the office, and everyone loves each other, like a big family", it's ironic.

### End

This year I am still moving bricks seriously, and I have achieved excellent performance, but compared with the previous year, I am no longer willing to recommend friends to fight for more. After all, I want to go, and there is no need to bring others. The company is getting stricter and treating its employees worse and worse.

In addition, in early 2020, an epidemic broke out, the world began to reshuffle, and my departure plan was also disrupted.

# 2020

Speed ​​up, speed up, speed up

### After the Spring Festival

After the seventh day of the first lunar month, due to the opinions of the big bosses, the department heads encouraged the Shanghai employees to go back to work. This part was too lazy to talk about, and it has been spit out. The company blatantly ignored the Shanghai system and ignored the health and safety of employees.

After going to work, I asked my colleagues from Hubei. On the surface, the company said that the days that were not at work could be covered by weekends and on duty, implying that the current month’s wages would be paid as usual. According to colleagues, the current month’s wages have already been deducted. Yes, I'm too lazy to work overtime, so I just take leave at my own expense.

### Why not leave

I want to leave. Because of the great uncertainty brought about by the epidemic in 2020, the whole year can pass like this. Personally, I admit that because the salary has risen, my girlfriend is not in a hurry, and the external environment is confusing, so I decided to do it for a while before leaving. This has been a whole year, and this year really witnessed all kinds of history.

### Eliminate foreshadowing

Foreshadowing 4: Cancel the meal

Maybe because the company likes to let employees eat at a fixed point, it won't work one second early. Assuming that employees order bread for dinner, they can eat out, and come back to take the bread after the meal, bypassing the "slave" eating time.

According to the company’s management experience, going out to eat is not a duty. After all, this means that the company’s meals are not good and it is an unruly behavior. So the dessert for dinner and Zhou Hei Ya are cancelled.

And due to the epidemic, Meicai will no longer be used as a supplier in 2020. The original 20+ option, now only 4 restaurants can choose, this is not the point. The point is that the company still enforces a strict eating time, and it is only allowed to take it after 11:59:59. It was originally the items on the shelf, and now it needs to be distributed manually by the supplier, and the efficiency should be lower.

Foreshadowing 5: Mobile phone signal shielding in the office

Connecting to mobile phone hotspots has been going on for several months, and I have been using it at my own expense. The office network has only 10M bandwidth, and downloading things is slow.

In August 2020, I suddenly found that the mobile phone network freezes violently from 1 to 11 o'clock every day, and it is almost unusable. Since there are many devices that need to be connected to the Internet, I use hotspots during the test. After that, my work was severely hindered.

At the beginning, I thought that too many people were connected to the cellular network, which caused the network to be stuck and unavailable. After investigation, it was found that it was a regional problem. Only the station where I was located could not use the traffic. Other floors and other work areas were fine. Slowly, every floor and every work area became unavailable, and more and more evidences indicated that it was signal interference. How should I say, I can only wish Pinduoduo better and better.


### Long illness becomes a doctor

The company doesn't like to issue holiday notices in advance, usually only a few days before the holidays. Because I am a regular employee, I already know the holiday forecasts well. For example, one day will be deducted for Qingming Festival and Dragon Boat Festival, two days will be deducted for National Day, and there will be no rest on weekends of big promotion.

Employees who have recently joined the company often come to ask me about holiday arrangements. Every time I predict it accurately, I know that the company will deduct holidays, and even sum up the rules. I don’t know if I should laugh.

December 10, 2020

The office is too noisy. The next door is just like the Internet cafe is dark. I have a nervous breakdown and can’t go to work. Earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones can’t solve the problem. Fortunately, I am leaving.

### Public events

In 2020, my feelings for Pinduoduo have dropped rapidly. In fact, it is consistent with the public perception. It is nothing more than the following events

1. The building prohibits employees from wearing slippers, their throats are locked by security and minor injuries, the company has not made any statement;
2. As there is no pit, the company did not make any statement when defecate in the men's urinal in a hurry;
3. The network transmission company uses tricky calculation methods to give out 0.3 times the Sunday overtime pay (normal settlement is 1.0 times, and the labor law stipulates 2.0 times);
4. Huang Zheng publicly expressed the hard-core struggle model. Non-technical employees were transferred to a lot of grocery shopping. They were open all year round. The renting agency told me that your company had recently left many people;
5. Slightly, in fact, the public knows it.

### Another school recruitment

The school recruitment season is here. Good news and bad news. The good news is that the enrollment level of this year's school is much better than last year. The bad news is that the company has had many negative incidents recently, and students will come to ask for comments and opinions. To be honest, I feel very uncomfortable.

### Heartbroken overnight duty

Since 618, 1010, 1111, 1212, and New Year's Eve in 2019 have been arranged, I am no longer surprised by all the upcoming operations. The most classic is December.

During the double twelve promotion, employees need to work for 13 consecutive days, and all employees need to work overtime until 1 am on 12.11 and 12.12, and then all employees need to work overtime until 1 am on 12.31. Because I have already submitted my resignation, there is no need to work for the company anymore. There is still no extra salary for these three days. To put it bluntly, all the staff are for nothing. You are just a robot, just follow the order.

### Resign

My girlfriend and I have been in a different place for almost two years. It’s not a way to do this all the time. Anyway, I hate the company’s behavior.

On December 9, 2020, I couldn’t bear the company’s culture and system. The flanker also left. There is nothing left to miss. I also have family reasons. I decided to leave this ghost place. The online company has a card resignation operation. I wrote that day. Resignation letter and ems. Stop here, I will probably have a more exciting second article "How to Resign from Pinduoduo in Disgrace".

### He Benfen

I thought I could leave quietly on January 10, 2021. Unexpectedly, 2021 will be more exciting, so I don’t need to say more about it. Sudden death, jumping from a building, seeing an ambulance being fired, and being fired by the crowd. . . So far, Pinduoduo has completely blackened in my heart, and there is no trace of humanity.

Because I have only worked in Tencent and Pinduoduo, here I want to praise Tencent. The first school recruitment training was mostly about history and values. At worst, it was brainwashing. I still remember cooperation, integrity, and innovation. , Enterprising. In the past, I always thought that values ​​were useless. Now I think Tencent’s values ​​are correct. When I leave Pinduoduo, I think about what my duty is. I will briefly talk about my understanding. It does not represent an official explanation. I look forward to the official one day. Can there be an explanation.

Emphasize that employees abide by all the company’s arrangements, whether the arrangements are reasonable or not; Emphasize not to do anything that has nothing to do with the company, even during breaks; Emphasize that you are a contracted worker of the company, a mercenary, and a human battery. What can you do? Just do what you do.

Pinduoduo has no soul. The word “duty” has long since changed. It has become a tool for enslaving employees, and ridiculed privately, such as "Did you do your duty this morning?" means "Did you check in at 11:00 today?", "Going there at noon" Do you mean "to eat at the office at noon or go out to eat", "I'm not doing my duty tonight", "I won't work overtime tonight, I want to run early", "you are not doing my duty" referring to "you "I’m making reactionary remarks", "I won’t do my duty this Sunday" means "I won’t work overtime this Sunday", "I will never do my duty anymore" means "I am leaving."

Quoting a reactionary remark from a colleague: "In Pinduoduo, don't talk too much about other things except giving money. Don't be surprised if anything happens." There is quite a feeling of 2077 Night City.

# Conclusion

Advising students not to come is not because of the serious overtime work, but because this place does not treat you as a person. I think the employees are batteries, slaves, and self-employed workers. This place is a sweatshop, prison, and concentration camp. Pinduoduo does give more money than other companies. If you are in an ordinary family and you are short of money, you can come to sell your life, otherwise you should look elsewhere. I don’t regret joining Pinduoduo. Each era has its limitations. The Pinduoduo in 2018 is not the Pinduoduo it is now. At that time, it was the best choice for me. If I was looking for a job in 2020, I would Would never consider this place.

It took two days to write my three-year memoir, and now I have the most memories in the first year, and most of them are beautiful. Although the last two years are painful, there seems to be so much to remember. I think The overtime is too serious to think about what I hate. Fortunately, I have a diary to record. There are other dissatisfactions related to work, and they are always "this is an urgent need from Ding Dong (CTO) and Abu (COO)", "this plan is unreasonable, but Abu said", I can't say too much because of confidentiality Now, let’s look at it. The next two years are more of a running account. It doesn’t matter, it’s just the feeling of a front-line employee.

How busy was the next two years? For example, my girlfriend is responsible for shopping, and she is responsible for all the things around me. She is even responsible for buying a house because I am too busy to consider these things. I really appreciate her and love her very much. After I left Pinduoduo, I finally had time to accompany her.

Finally, let’s share the check-in records for 2020. My working hours are not long, and everything is clearly stated.

Supplement 1: Regarding the check-in record at the end, it is mainly for other employees of the company. I personally go to bed early and get up early, come from 9-10 am and leave from 21-22 am, but most of the employees have a schedule of 11-22, and some employees have a schedule of 14-early morning, which has a greater relationship with the department; if I cause other Pinduoduo employees are dissatisfied and apologize.

Supplement 2: About buying a house. It’s not a house in Shanghai and my parents have provided funds. Please don’t pay attention to it. The company’s salary is confidential. I have the obligation to keep it confidential regardless of whether I am employed or not.
