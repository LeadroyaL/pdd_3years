The markdown file pdd_3year.md contains the same content as on cc98.org and my blog.

~~The service (my blog) gradually became inaccessible starting from 11:15, and I kept trying to restart and repair it until 11:50. Whenever the port was opened, it (the server) would go down again immediately. I don't know how to analyze the logs, so I'm sharing the log files and hoping that the right people can help me analyze them.~~

Jan 15, 2021: I think my little server was shot down by normal traffic, so there's no need to discuss it. Disabling issues permanently.

# Translator's notes
1. All the dates and times mentioned in this article are in China Standard Time (UTC+8) and 24 hours format.
2. The original article in mandarin Chinese was quite informal, often not conforming to grammar rules, so I took the liberty to interpret and rephrase where, I think, is appropriate. If it sounds strange, it probably was me not thinking in English.
3. The original poster was an information security engineer at Pinduoduo.
4. The original title was "my 3 years at Pinduoduo".
